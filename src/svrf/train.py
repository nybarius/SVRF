"""The batched train: fold a family of ready pull requests onto the base branch, gate the
folded tree once, land the family one merge commit at a time, and check that the base
branch ends on exactly the tree that was gated.

One run over a list of pull-request numbers:

1. One pull-request list snapshot (the rate budget read first, and waited out below
   `rate_floor`).
2. The pairwise conflict read: which heads conflict with which, on which paths. A
   conflict only on union-merged paths does not separate two heads. The largest
   pairwise-compatible set is kept; a head that conflicts with it is OUT for this run,
   named with its partners and paths.
3. The kept heads are folded onto the base in order with the union step (git's merge of
   the base into the head, union paths resolved by union), which is the same step the
   landing performs, and cut into families of `family_size`. Family k is gated on the
   fold of families 1..k (speculative stacking), so families gate in parallel (`jobs`)
   and every gated tree is still exactly a tree the base branch will hold.
4. A green family lands in order. For each pull request the base is re-read, the union
   step is recomputed on the current base and must equal the planned tree, is pushed to
   the pull request's branch by refspec, mergeability is read, and the pull request is
   merged with a merge commit pinned to that sha. The merged tree is fetched and compared
   with the planned tree; a mismatch alerts and stops the train. A commit landing on the
   base from outside between two merges stops the family, and the rest is regated.
5. A red family is bisected: each half is replanned on the current base and gated; a
   green half lands, a red half is split again, and a red single pull request is held
   with its failing lines.
6. A failed read is never a conflict or a hold: it is retried later. A rate limit is
   waited out until its reported reset.

What the gate covers: the tree each family (or bisected segment) ends on. The
intermediate trees between two merges of one family are prefix folds that were not
gated; a family stopped midway is recorded PREFIX_LANDED_UNGATED.

The receipt (one JSON file per run) is rewritten after every event, so an interrupted
run leaves its last state on disk.
