"""Replay a historical snapshot: given already-merged pull request numbers, reconstruct
each one's head and the base it merged onto from its own merge commit (an ordinary
two-parent merge -- a squash or rebase merge has no reconstructable head and is
reported, not guessed), open them as pull requests against a local stand-in for GitHub
(`LocalHub`) carrying the same commit graph, and run the ordinary admission read and
family planning -- and, with `gate=True`, the ordinary gate -- exactly as a live round
would.

Nothing here lands: replay never pushes, merges, or comments against the real remote;
every write happens in a throwaway local origin this module owns.

    svrf replay --merged 101,102,103 [--base <sha-or-ref>] [--gate]

`base` is the round every listed pull request is replayed against. Left out, every
listed pull request's own reconstructed base (its merge commit's first parent) must be
identical -- true for the sole member of a round, refused otherwise, since the train
model has one current base per round. To replay several pull requests as the family
they actually landed together, pass their shared original round base explicitly:
prefer the first (lowest-numbered, earliest-landed) member's own reconstructed base
over a receipt's `family["base"]` -- for every family after the first in a round that
speculatively stacked families on each other's unlanded folds, that field can be a
"train preview" commit that was never pushed anywhere durable and will not be present
in any real clone.

A pull request that was pushed to more than once before it merged is reconstructed only
at the state its own merge commit carries, not any earlier, since-superseded push: a
head repaired or relanded along the way and then merged cleanly is read here only as
"merged cleanly", the same way a live snapshot only ever sees the current push.
