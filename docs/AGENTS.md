# Agent hooks

SVRF holds and re-reads pull requests automatically; a coding agent whose pull request
got held has no way to find out why except polling the repository and guessing. These
three surfaces exist so an agent can ask directly, in its own tool loop, without a human
relaying the answer:

| Surface | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `svrf why <pr>` | Why this one pull request is held or where it sits in the queue, its failing lines, and a plain next step. |
| `svrf status --json` | Every held pull request and the outcome of the last round, from local state only (no network call). |
| `svrf mcp` | The same two reads, plus `requeue`, exposed as MCP tools over stdio for an agent's own tool-calling loop. |

All three read local state only (`<state_dir>/state.json`, `<state_dir>/receipts/`): they
never call GitHub, so an agent can call them as often as it likes without spending rate
budget.

## `svrf why` and `svrf status`

```sh
svrf why 128
```

```json
{
 "repo": "owner/name",
 "number": 128,
 "state": "HELD",
 "reason": "GATE_RED",
 "head": "abc123def456",
 "failing": ["FAILED tests/test_thing.py::test_it"],
 "paths": [],
 "since": "20260925T120000Z",
 "next_step": "Fix the failing lines above on this branch and push a new commit; svrf reads it again automatically."
}
```

`state` is one of `HELD`, `MERGED`, `OUT_THIS_ROUND`, a family status from the last round
(`PLANNED`, `GATED`, `RED`, `BISECTED`, ...), or `UNKNOWN` when svrf has not read this
pull request yet. `svrf status --json` (the `--json` flag is accepted for scripts and
agents; the command's output is JSON either way) gives the same held list for every open
pull request at once, plus the last round's summary.

## `svrf mcp`

A minimal MCP server over stdio (newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0), started with:

```sh
svrf --config svrf.toml mcp
```

It exposes three tools:

- **`queue_status`** — no arguments; the same object as `svrf status --json`.
- **`why_held(pr)`** — the same object as `svrf why <pr>`.
- **`requeue(pr)`** — clears `pr`'s hold record so svrf reads its head again next round.
  This is the *only* tool with a side effect, and the side effect is narrow: it deletes
  one entry from local state. It never merges, gates, pushes, or touches GitHub in any
  way — the next scheduled round decides what happens to the pull request from scratch,
  exactly as if it had never been held.

### Wiring it into an agent

Most MCP-capable coding agents take a stdio server command in their own config. For
example, in an agent that reads a JSON list of MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "svrf": {
      "command": "svrf",
      "args": ["--config", "svrf.toml", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example agent prompt

A prompt for an agent that just pushed a pull request and wants to close the loop itself,
instead of waiting on a human to notice a hold:

> Your pull request may be picked up by SVRF, a merge train that gates and lands pull
> requests automatically. If it has not merged after a few minutes, call the `why_held`
> tool with your pull request number. If it reports `state: "HELD"`, read `failing` and
> `next_step`, fix the problem on your branch, and push — SVRF re-reads the new head on
> its own; you do not need to call `requeue`. Only call `requeue` if you believe the hold
> was based on a now-stale state (for example, you already pushed a fix and SVRF has not
> re-read it in longer than one round's interval). Never merge, force-push, or bypass the
> gate yourself; `requeue` only clears a hold record, and SVRF's own gate decides whether
> your fix actually passes.

## Security

Every tool here is read-only except `requeue`, and `requeue`'s only effect is described
above. None of the three surfaces runs a shell command with attacker-controlled input:
`svrf why`/`svrf status` read JSON files under `state_dir`, and the MCP server dispatches
on a fixed tool name to the same in-process functions the CLI uses. No surface accepts or
constructs a git ref, branch name, or shell command from its arguments.
