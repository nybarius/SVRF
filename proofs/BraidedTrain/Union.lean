# BraidedTrain.Union — the line-level union merge as a model step

`svrf.rules.union_lines(theirs, ours)` keeps the base side's lines in order and appends each
line of the pull request's side that is not already there, once. `unionLines` is that
function on lists of lines. `git.RealGit.union_step` applies it only on configured union
paths, and only when every path git's merge reports as conflicted is a union path; any
other conflicted path keeps the two heads apart. Finite lists, no Mathlib.

1. `count_unionLines`: the count of a line after a union is its count on the base side,
   plus one exactly when the base side lacks it and the pull request's side has it. Every
   other statement here follows from this formula.
2. `unionLines_append`, `unionLines_assoc`: grouping does not matter, exactly (as lists).
   Folding the additions of a family one at a time is folding their union.
3. `unionLines_comm`: two unions onto the same base in either order give the same lines
   with the same counts (`SameCounts`, i.e. `List.Perm`). They are not equal as lists in general
   (`union_order_visible`): the order of appended lines is the fold order. A git tree is
   byte identity, so fold order still decides which tree is gated; the train fixes the fold
   order once and replays it at landing, and the landed-tree check compares bytes.
4. The path level. A change is a list of edits, each a whole-content replacement of a path
   or a union of lines onto a path. `change_comm`: two changes applied in either order give
   trees that agree path by path up to line order (`SameLines`), under exactly the
   hypothesis the union repair enforces (`UnionOnlyOverlap`): every path both changes edit
   is edited by union on both sides. `family_perm`: the same holds for any reordering of a
   family whose changes are pairwise so compatible, so fold order within a family changes
   at most the order of union-merged lines.

Modelling boundary: git merges a non-union file edited on both sides hunk by hunk; this
model treats such a path as a conflict (the coarser, path-level reading used by
`apply_comm_of_disjoint`), and it treats every edit of a union path as a union of lines.
